# Operators

Operators allow us to control how commands interact, chain together, and handle input/output in the Linux shell.
They’re the glue that lets you build more powerful one-liners and automation scripts.

```
&& — AND operator: runs the next command only if the previous one succeeds.  
|| — OR operator: runs the next command only if the previous one fails.
; — Command separator: runs multiple commands in sequence, even if one fails.  

| — Pipe operator: sends the output of one command as the input of another (don’t confuse this with ||).

> — Redirect (overwrite): erases a file and writes the command’s output to it.  
>> — Append redirect: adds the output to the end of a file without erasing it.

< — Input redirect: reads input to a command from a file instead of from the keyboard.  
<< EOF ... EOF — Here-Doc: lets you provide a block of text as input to a command.  
<<< — Here-String: redirects a single string as input to a command.

```

## Ternary Operators

1. In Linux, when a command is executed, it has a status code returned. If the code is 0, the program executed successfully.
Anything other than 0, indicates a failure.
Man pages of a command may indicate what the different codes mean, for example curl uses 6 for unresolvable host and 3 for malformed URLs

The shell variable `$?` always stores the status of the previous command. Consider the code below. 

```
echo "hello world"
echo $?             # prints 0, indicating the previous command passed
ech "hello world"
echo $?             # prints 1, indicating the previous command failed
```

2. Ternary operators use the `$?` to determine which path to take. Run the commands below, try and consider why each one prints Success or Fail.

```
curl not_a_valid_domain && echo "Success" || echo "Fail" 

curl ifconfig.me && echo "Success" || echo "Fail"

curl ifconfig.me && ech "Success" || echo "Fail" # why do we see Fail here?
```
