# System Monitoring

Linux systems provide a variety of tools for monitoring performance, processes, and resource usage.
Understanding how to observe system behavior under load is essential for diagnosing performance issues and ensuring reliability.


1. Install a tool named stress. Stress is designed to simulate workloads on a server.
```
sudo dnf install stress
```

2. Run a stress test
```
stress -c4
```

3. Examine the top of your system
```
top
```

4. Kill the stress test
```
pkill -9 stress
```

> “Which processes are consuming the most CPU? How can you confirm that the stress tool is responsible?”
