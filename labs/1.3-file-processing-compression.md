## Printing Files

1. Run the commands below to create some files. We will use these files for the activity.
```
cat << EOF > data.txt
Linux 90
C 80
Python 89
EOF

cat << EOF > code.js
let i=0;
while(map()...
EOF
```

2. Print the contents of the file
```
cat data.txt
```

3. Print the contents of both files
```
cat data.txt code.js
```

4. Print the contents of data.txt in reverse
```
tac data.txt
```

5. Print the last 3 lines of data.txt
```
tail -3 data.txt
```

6. Print the first line of code.js
```
head -1 code.js
```

## Reading Files

It is not efficient to print large files to your console and read them. Lets make use of `less`, which allows you to scroll through a file and even search for text.

1. Use less to read data.txt
```
less data.txt
```
