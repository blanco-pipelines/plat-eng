# Linux Jobs

A job in Linux is a process started by a user within a shell session. 
Jobs can run in the foreground (actively using the terminal) or in the background (running without blocking the terminal).
Managing jobs helps you multitask and control processes efficiently.


## Maintaining Jobs


1. Lets run a process in the background
```
sleep 1000 &
```

2. Confirm its running with ps and jobs command
```
ps -ef | grep [s]leep
jobs
```

3. Terminate the job. Note that you can use the PID, Job Number, or even %+ for the most recent job.
```
kill -9 %+
```

4. Create 3 sleep processes and terminate the second one.
```
sleep 1000 &
sleep 2000 &
sleep 3000 &

kill %2 # or use the PID. You can also use %- for second to last job! 
```

5. Kill all remaining jobs.
```
kill %1
kill %3
```

## Background and Foreground

1. Create a sleep process, interrupt it with Ctrl+Z, which sends the SIGTSTP (terminal stop) signal to pause the process and move it to the background. Then resume it in the background using bg %+, which sends the SIGCONT (continue) signal to restart the stopped job.
```
sleep 1000
Ctrl+Z
jobs   # confirm the job is stopped in background
bg %+  # you can also use the job number 
```
