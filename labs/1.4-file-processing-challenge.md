# Lab 1.4 – File Processing Challenge

This lab will strengthen your file-handling, organization, and text-processing skills in Linux.
Follow the steps carefully and complete each one using only the command line — no GUI.

## Part 1: File and Directory Management
1. Create a new directory named work in your home folder.
2. Inside work, create two subdirectories named logs and backup.
3. Copy the system log file /var/log/syslog into the logs folder.
4. Verify the copy by listing files in logs using long format and human-readable size.
5. Make a second copy of the same file inside backup, and rename it syslog.bak.
6. Use ls options to display:
  - All files (including hidden ones)
  - Sorted by file size
  - Sorted by modification time (reverse order)
7. Create an empty file named notes.txt inside work and confirm its creation with ls -l.
8. Remove notes.txt and confirm it’s deleted.
9. Use one command to move the syslog.bak file from backup into logs.


## Part 2: File Processing and Comparison
1. Navigate into the logs directory.
2. Read through the syslog file without using cat.
3. Save the reversed contents of the file into a new file named syslog.rev in your home folder.
4. Compare /var/log/syslog and syslog.rev using diff, and save the output to syslog.diff.
5. Rename syslog.diff to syslog.rev.diff.
6. List all files in logs in reverse order by modification time, then by size.
7. Print only the lines from syslog.rev.diff that exist in syslog but not in syslog.rev.
8. Save the first 20 lines of syslog.rev to a new file called syslog.rev.head.

## Part 3: Clean Up and Verification
10. Copy all .rev and .diff files into a new directory named backup in your home folder.
11. Verify the total size of both directories (logs and backup).

## Part 4: Compression
1. Create a new directory in home folder named archive and use tar to compress all files from the logs folder into archive/syslog.tar.gz.
Verify the archive contents without extracting it.

# Outcome:
By completing this challenge, you’ll have used ls, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, diff, grep, redirection, and piping — essential Linux commands for any system administrator.
