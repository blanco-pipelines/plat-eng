# Lab 1.4 – File Processing Challenge

This lab will strengthen your file-handling, organization, and text-processing skills in Linux.
Follow the steps carefully and complete each one using only the command line — no GUI.

## Part 1: File and Directory Management
1. Create a new directory named work in your home folder.
2. Inside work, create two subdirectories named logs and backup.
3. Copy the system log file /var/log/cloud-init.log into the logs folder.
4. Verify the copy by listing files in logs using long format and human-readable size.
5. Make a second copy of the same file inside backup, and rename it cloud-init.log.bak.
6. Use ls options to display:
  - All files (including hidden ones)
  - Sorted by file size
  - Sorted by modification time (reverse order)
7. Create an empty file named notes.txt inside work and confirm its creation with ls -l.
8. Remove notes.txt and confirm it’s deleted.
9. Use one command to move the syslog.bak file from backup into logs.


## Part 2: File Processing and Comparison
1. Navigate into the logs directory.
2. Read through the cloud-init.log file without using cat.
3. Save the reversed contents of the file into a new file named cloud-init.rev in your home folder.
4. Compare /var/log/cloud-init.log and cloud-init.rev using diff, and save the output to cloud-init.diff.
5. Rename cloud-init.diff to cloud-init.rev.diff.
6. List all files in logs in reverse order by modification time, then by size.
7. Print only the lines from cloud-init.rev.diff that exist in cloud-init.log but not in cloud-init.rev.
8. Save the first 20 lines of cloud-init.rev to a new file called cloud-init.rev.head.
9. Make a hard link to cloud-init.rev.head and a soft link.
10. delete cloud-init.rev.head, then use ls -l to examine the soft link. 

## Part 3: Clean Up and Verification
10. Copy all .rev and .diff files into a new directory named backup in your home folder.
11. Verify the total size of both directories (logs and backup).

## Part 4: Compression
1. Create a new directory in home folder named archive and use tar to compress all files from the logs folder into archive/cloud-init.tar.gz.
Verify the archive contents without extracting it.

# Outcome:
By completing this challenge, you’ll have used ls, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, diff, grep, redirection, and piping — essential Linux commands for any system administrator.
