# Lab 1.1: Introduction to GitHub Actions Workflows

## Overview

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. In this lab, you'll create your first workflow - a simple "Hello World" automation that runs whenever you push code.

**What You'll Learn:**
- GitHub Actions workflow syntax
- Triggering workflows with events
- Running jobs and steps
- Viewing workflow results
- Basic YAML structure

---

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of Git
- Text editor

---

## Part 1: Create a Repository (5 minutes)

### 1.1 Create New Repository

1. Go to GitHub and click **New repository**
2. Configure:
   - **Name:** `github-actions-hello-world`
   - **Description:** "Learning GitHub Actions workflows"
   - **Public** repository
   - ✅ Initialize with README
3. Click **Create repository**

### 1.2 Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/github-actions-hello-world.git
cd github-actions-hello-world
```

---

## Part 2: Create Your First Workflow (10 minutes)

### 2.1 Create Workflow Directory

GitHub Actions looks for workflows in `.github/workflows/` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 2.2 Create Workflow File

Create `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml`:

```yaml
name: Hello World Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Say Hello
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
      
      - name: Print Date
        run: date
      
      - name: Print Working Directory
        run: pwd
      
      - name: List Files
        run: ls -la
```

**Understanding the Workflow:**

- **`name:`** - Friendly name shown in GitHub UI
- **`on:`** - Events that trigger the workflow (push, pull_request)
- **`jobs:`** - One or more jobs to run
- **`runs-on:`** - The type of machine to run on
- **`steps:`** - Individual tasks to execute

### 2.3 Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/hello-world.yml
git commit -m "Add hello world workflow"
git push origin main
```

---

## Part 3: View Workflow Results (5 minutes)

### 3.1 Navigate to Actions Tab

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see "Hello World Workflow" running or completed

### 3.2 View Workflow Details

1. Click on the workflow run
2. Click on the **greet** job
3. Expand each step to see output:
   - "Say Hello" shows: `Hello, GitHub Actions!`
   - "Print Date" shows: current timestamp
   - "Print Working Directory" shows: `/home/runner/work/...`
   - "List Files" shows: repository contents

---

## Part 4: Enhance the Workflow (10 minutes)

### 4.1 Add More Steps

Edit `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml`:

```yaml
name: Hello World Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering

jobs:
  greet:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Say Hello
        run: echo "Hello, GitHub Actions!"
      
      - name: Print Date and Time
        run: date
      
      - name: Show System Information
        run: |
          echo "OS: $(uname -s)"
          echo "Architecture: $(uname -m)"
          echo "Kernel: $(uname -r)"
      
      - name: Print Environment Variables
        run: |
          echo "GitHub Actor: ${{ github.actor }}"
          echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
          echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref }}"
      
      - name: List Repository Files
        run: ls -la
      
      - name: Say Goodbye
        run: echo "Workflow completed successfully!"
```

**New Features:**

- **`workflow_dispatch:`** - Allows manual workflow triggering
- **`uses: actions/checkout@v4`** - Checks out your repository code
- **Multi-line commands** with `|`
- **GitHub context variables** like `${{ github.actor }}`

### 4.2 Commit Changes

```bash
git add .github/workflows/hello-world.yml
git commit -m "Enhance workflow with more steps"
git push origin main
```

### 4.3 View Updated Results

Check the Actions tab - you'll see richer output with system info and environment variables.

---

## Part 5: Manual Workflow Trigger (5 minutes)

Since you added `workflow_dispatch`, you can now trigger the workflow manually!

### 5.1 Trigger Manually

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click **Hello World Workflow** (left sidebar)
3. Click **Run workflow** button (right side)
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click **Run workflow**

The workflow runs without needing a push!

---

## Part 6: Create a Multi-Job Workflow (10 minutes)

### 6.1 Create Advanced Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/multi-job.yml`:

```yaml
name: Multi-Job Workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  job1:
    name: First Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Step 1
        run: echo "This is Job 1, Step 1"
      
      - name: Step 2
        run: echo "This is Job 1, Step 2"
  
  job2:
    name: Second Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1  # Waits for job1 to complete
    
    steps:
      - name: Step 1
        run: echo "This is Job 2, Step 1"
      
      - name: Step 2
        run: echo "This is Job 2, Step 2"
  
  job3:
    name: Third Job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [job1, job2]  # Waits for both job1 and job2
    
    steps:
      - name: Final Step
        run: echo "All jobs completed!"
```

**Job Dependencies:**
- `job2` waits for `job1` to finish
- `job3` waits for both `job1` and `job2`
- Jobs without dependencies run in parallel

### 6.2 Test Multi-Job Workflow

```bash
git add .github/workflows/multi-job.yml
git commit -m "Add multi-job workflow"
git push origin main
```

Go to Actions → Multi-Job Workflow → Run workflow

Watch how jobs execute in order!

---

## Part 7: Understanding Workflow Status (5 minutes)

### 7.1 Workflow Status Icons

- **Green checkmark** - Success
- **Red X** - Failed
- **Yellow circle** - In progress
- **Gray circle** - Queued

### 7.2 Create a Failing Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/test-failure.yml`:

```yaml
name: Test Failure Handling

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  will-fail:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: This will succeed
        run: echo "Success!"
      
      - name: This will fail
        run: exit 1
      
      - name: This won't run
        run: echo "You won't see this"
```

### 7.3 Run and Observe

Trigger this workflow manually and watch it fail at step 2. Notice that step 3 never runs because the workflow stops on failure.

## Understanding GitHub Actions Concepts

### Workflows
- YAML files in `.github/workflows/`
- Define automation processes
- Triggered by events

### Events
- `push` - Code pushed to repository
- `pull_request` - PR opened/updated
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual trigger
- `schedule` - Cron-based timing
- Many more!

### Jobs
- A set of steps that run on the same runner
- Run in parallel by default
- Can have dependencies (`needs`)

### Steps
- Individual tasks in a job
- Can run commands or use actions
- Execute sequentially

### Runners
- Virtual machines that run workflows
- GitHub-hosted: `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`
- Can also use self-hosted runners

## Key Takeaways

**What You Learned:**
- Creating GitHub Actions workflows
- YAML workflow syntax
- Triggering workflows (push, manual)
- Jobs, steps, and dependencies
- Using GitHub context variables
- Viewing workflow results

**Why This Matters:**
- Foundation for all CI/CD automation
- Same concepts apply to complex pipelines
- No infrastructure to manage
- Free for public repositories

---

## Cleanup (Optional)

To remove the repository:
1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
3. Click **Delete this repository**
4. Follow confirmation steps

---

## Next Steps

In the next lab, you'll:
- Build a real application
- Add automated testing
- Create Docker images
- Deploy to cloud infrastructure

**From "Hello World" to production-ready CI/CD!** 🚀

---

## Additional Challenges (Optional)

### Challenge 1: Scheduled Workflow
Create a workflow that runs every day at 9 AM UTC:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'
```

### Challenge 2: Conditional Steps
Add a step that only runs on the `main` branch:

```yaml
- name: Main Branch Only
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: echo "Running on main!"
```

**Congratulations!** You've created your first GitHub Actions workflows!
