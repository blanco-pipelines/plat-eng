# Terraform data sources — discover and reuse existing resources

Overview
- This lab shows how to use Terraform data sources to discover existing AWS resources (default VPC, its subnets, default security group, and the AWS caller identity) and then create a small EC2 instance that reuses those discovered resources and tags it with who ran Terraform.

Why this is useful
- Real projects often must integrate with existing infrastructure. Data sources let your configuration read what already exists and act accordingly without hard-coding IDs.
- We'll parse the caller identity to record who created the resource for simple audit tagging.

Goals
- Read default VPC and its subnets
- Read the default security group in that VPC
- Read the caller identity and derive a "CreatedBy" tag
- Create one EC2 instance that reuses the discovered subnet and SG, and tags it with the creator/account

Prerequisites
- AWS credentials configured and permitted to read VPCs, subnets, SGs and create an EC2 instance
- Terraform installed
- **Important**: This lab requires a default VPC in your AWS region. Most AWS accounts have one by default, but if yours was deleted, you can recreate it using the VPC console or AWS CLI: `aws ec2 create-default-vpc --region us-west-1`

Setup
1. Create a new folder (e.g., `tf-lab-data`) and open it in VS Code.
2. Create the files below (or copy into your existing lab folder). Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy` when finished.

Example Terraform configuration (minimal, production-hardening omitted)

- versions.tf (provider/version pinning)

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

- variables.tf

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-west-1"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type for lab"
  type        = string
  default     = "t3.micro"
}

variable "resource_tags" {
  description = "Base tags to apply"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {
    project     = "data-lab"
    environment = "dev"
  }
}
```

- main.tf (data sources + resource)

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# Who is running this?
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Extract a friendly creator name from the ARN (works for user or role ARNs)
locals {
  creator_arn    = data.aws_caller_identity.current.arn
  creator_parts  = split("/", local.creator_arn)
  # For IAM users: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/john -> "john"
  # For assumed roles: arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/MyRole/session -> "MyRole"
  creator        = length(local.creator_parts) > 1 ? element(local.creator_parts, length(local.creator_parts) - 1) : local.creator_arn
  account_id     = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}

# Find the default VPC in the region
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  filter {
    name   = "isDefault"
    values = ["true"]
  }
}

# List subnets in the default VPC and pick the first one
data "aws_subnets" "default_vpc" {
  filter {
    name   = "vpc-id"
    values = [data.aws_vpc.default.id]
  }
}

# Default security group for that VPC
data "aws_security_group" "default" {
  name   = "default"
  vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.default.id
}

# Latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI (example data source usage)
data "aws_ami" "al2" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}

# Create a small instance that reuses discovered subnet + SG, and tags with creator info
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami                    = data.aws_ami.al2.id
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  subnet_id              = element(tolist(data.aws_subnets.default_vpc.ids), 0)
  vpc_security_group_ids = [data.aws_security_group.default.id]

  tags = merge(var.resource_tags, {
    CreatedBy  = local.creator
    AccountId  = local.account_id
    Source     = "data-lab"
  })
}
```

- outputs.tf

```hcl
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}

output "vpc_id" {
  value = data.aws_vpc.default.id
}

output "default_sg_id" {
  value = data.aws_security_group.default.id
}

output "created_by" {
  value = local.creator
}
```

Run the lab
- terraform init
- terraform plan
- terraform apply
  - Confirm the instance is created and check the Tags in the EC2 console; you should see CreatedBy and AccountId tags.
- terraform output to view outputs.

Discussion / variations
- Instead of creating an instance, you could locate existing instances with `data "aws_instances"` and use their attributes.
- Show how the configuration adapts if the account has no default VPC (the data lookup will fail) — discuss defensive patterns (data source existence checks, conditional resources).
- Parse `data.aws_caller_identity.current.arn` to distinguish user vs role and show different tagging/ownership policies.

Cleanup
- terraform destroy
- Verify the instance is terminated in the console.

Notes
- This lab demonstrates practical, safe uses of data sources to adapt to existing infra and to record operator metadata.
- If you want, I can supply a version that finds an existing running instance and simply tags it (instead of creating a new one) — useful when you don't want to launch resources in the lab.
